algorithm:

For day in [pon wt Å›r czw pt]

1. Find TR where first TD contains pon
2. import all TDs matching regex as day numbers
3. lookup roman to months
4. 7 next TRs are hours
5. instantiate arrays of length len(days) for all hours
6. for each TD in hour: event = text(td)
7. colspan -> for x in range(colspan): hours[j][i + x] = event
8. rowspan -> for y in range(rowspan): hours[j + y][x] = event


for hour in hours: for h in hour: 
create date 
```
e.begin = '2014-01-01 00:00:00'
c.events.add(e)
